# Notee



Using a forked monorepo project skeleton to combine React Native SPA and Express/Node/MongoDB backend.


## Backend
    Express/Node
    MongoDB/Mongoose
    
Deployed backend can be found at: https://testapinotee.herokuapp.com/

## Frontend

As I'm not anywhere near production version yet, I'm using Expo to host Notee for testing purposes.
Expo is the create-react-app or express-generator for React Native, including a mobile app that allows the testing of apps prior to deployment. I've deployed a 'production' version of Notee for testing purposes, as React Native may behave differently in a production environment

Using the App:

## For IOS Devices: 
    Download the Expo Client app
    Visit the hosted url on your phone, select 'Open project using Expo'

### Expo App on Apple Appstore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779
### Expo hosted Notee url: https://exp.host/@nandesuka/Notee

## For Android Devices:
    Download the Expo Client app
    Visit the hosted url on your phone, select 'Open project using Expo'

### Expo App on Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US
### Expo hosted Notee url: https://exp.host/@nandesuka/Notee
    


Notee is my first React Native project, and working on it truly is a labor of love. I always wanted a simpler, minimalist and customizable note taking app. Why not build it?

As I am early in this process, things will change as I explore new UI designs and navigation flows, as well as working with offline functionality, however here are how things look:
